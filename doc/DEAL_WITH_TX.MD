## Verifying Transactions and Retrieving Logs

This document outlines the two-step process for verifying a transaction's status and retrieving the detailed log events it generated using the Qubic REST API.

### Step 1: Verify the Transaction

To check the status of a specific transaction, send a `GET` request to the `/tx/{tx_hash}` endpoint.

**Command:**
```bash
curl <API_URL>/tx/{tx_hash}
```

**Example Request:**

```bash
curl <API_URL>/tx/mfqbthbgkejwbflawtfkolokgxybcgkqwegpfrtcyedkcymuzwrjypleswvn
```
When you receive the transaction data, pay close attention to these four key fields:

* `transactionIndex`: The position of the queried tx in `tickData`, this position is arranged by tick leader. If this field is missing or equal `-1` , it indicates that the queried transaction is not included to the tick.
* `isExecuted`: A boolean indicating if the transaction met all requirements and was successfully executed by the smart contract.
* `logIdFrom`: The starting ID for the log events generated by this transaction.
* `logIdTo`: The ending ID for the log events generated by this transaction.

The range between `logIdFrom` and `logIdTo` (inclusive) represents all log events produced by this single transaction. The number of logs can vary depending on the complexity of the smart contract logic.

### Step 2: Retrieve Transaction Logs

Once you have confirmed the transaction was executed and have the `logIdFrom` and `logIdTo` values, you can fetch the detailed log events.

Use the `GET /log/{epoch}/{from_id}/{to_id}` endpoint, passing the log IDs from Step 1 into the `{from_d}` and `{to_id}` parameters.

**Command:**

    curl <API_URL>/log/{epoch}/{logIdFrom}/{logIdTo}

### Example Scenario

Let's use the transaction `mfqbthbgkejwbflawtfkolokgxybcgkqwegpfrtcyedkcymuzwrjypleswvn`.

1.  **Query TX:** A developer queries `.../tx/mfqbthbgkejwbflawtfkolokgxybcgkqwegpfrtcyedkcymuzwrjypleswvn`.
2.  **Analyze Response:** The response shows `isExecuted: true` and provides a `logIdFrom` and `logIdTo`.
3.  **Example:** In this scenario, the transaction involved `DMIC...WAAK` sending 1 coin to QX, which was then returned. This generated two distinct events:
    * Event 1: Coin sent to QX.
    * Event 2: Coin returned from QX.
4.  **Query Logs:** The developer then calls `.../log/{epoch}/{logIdFrom}/{logIdTo}` to retrieve the full details of both events, confirming the entire flow of the transaction.
